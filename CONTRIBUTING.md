## Local Development
1. Run `./scripts/test`
   2. Make sure that all the tests you expect to pass, pass
3. Run `./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal`
   4. `-x test` can be added to the end if there are expected test failures. Step 1 can be omitted if all tests pass.
5. An entry should exist in your maven local cache (`.m2`) under `com/m3ter/sdk` which you can use in other maven / gradle projects
